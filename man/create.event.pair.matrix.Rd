\title{
	A UTILITY FUNCTION TO GENERATE AN EVENT-PAIR MATRIX REPRESENTATION OF A RANKED DEVELOPMENTAL SEQUENCE
}
\description{
	Taking a ranked developmental sequence as input, this function generates the corresponding event-pair matrix (including ?'s for any event-pairs that involve missing elements).
}
\usage{
create.event.pair.matrix(dev_seq)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dev_seq}{
	Developmental sequence in ranked format (integer vector)
}
}
